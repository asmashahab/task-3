PART A — Research Questions (Short answer)
1. What new improvements were introduced in Gemini 3.0?

Gemini 3 has much stronger reasoning, showing “state-of-the-art reasoning with unprecedented depth and nuance.”

2. How does Gemini 3.0 improve coding & automation workflows?

It introduces “vibe coding”, where you can describe what you want in natural language, and Gemini 3 Pro creates full interactive apps — handling multi-step planning, visual UI, and deeper interactivity.

Google released Antigravity, an agent-first development platform/IDE built around Gemini 3 that lets agents work across workspaces, producing “artifacts” (plans, screenshots, task lists) to track what they do.

For developers, Gemini 3 API includes a bash tool that can propose shell commands, facilitating automation (e.g. file operations, system tasks) in agentic workflows.

3. How does Gemini 3.0 improve multimodal understanding?

Gemini 3 significantly improves on image, document, and video understanding. According to Google, it sets new highs on benchmarks like MMMU-Pro (image + reasoning) and Video-MMMU.

The model has better spatial reasoning, enabling use cases like trajectory prediction, embodied reasoning (for robotics, XR devices), and understanding spatial layouts.

In document understanding, it goes beyond simple OCR: it reason’s over document content (tables, charts) intelligently.
